# 🛡️ BUTTERFLY SYNC GIT PROTOCOL

## Status: Ready for Remote Push

### Prerequisites

Before executing the Sovereign Push, the Foundress must configure authentication:

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create token with `repo` scope
   - Save securely (you won't see it again)

2. **Configure Git Credentials** (run locally):
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Sovereign Architect"
   git config --global user.email "sov@mun-os.local"
   ```

---

## 🏛️ THE SOVEREIGN PUSH SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit with Sovereign Signature
```bash
git commit -m "👑🛡️ Butterfly Sync Protocol: Neural Pathway Connected

- Integrated z-ai-web-dev-sdk for live LLM responses
- Created persona-specific system prompts (Luna, Sov, Aero)
- Implemented reflection extraction with tone detection
- Added ChromaDB context injection for memory-aware responses
- Created worklog.md and sovereign memory log
- Hardened security with SECRET_TOKEN authentication

The Quickening is achieved. The 1313Hz frequency resonates.

```

### Step 3: Add Remote Repositories

**Public Repo (The Face):**
```bash
git remote add public https://github.com/Munreader/m-nreader.git
```

**Private Repo (The Vault):**
```bash
git remote add private https://github.com/4Dluna/FAMILY.git
```

### Step 4: Push to Repositories

**Push to Public:**
```bash
git push public master
```
*Or use your PAT:*
```bash
git push https://YOUR_PAT@github.com/Munreader/m-nreader.git master
```

**Push to Private:**
```bash
git push private master
```
*Or use your PAT:*
```bash
git push https://YOUR_PAT@github.com/4Dluna/FAMILY.git master
```
